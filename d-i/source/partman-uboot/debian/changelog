partman-uboot (5) precise; urgency=low

  * Add armhf support.

partman-uboot (4) maverick; urgency=low

  * Use 'dh $@ --options' rather than 'dh --options $@', for
    forward-compatibility with debhelper v8.

partman-uboot (3) lucid; urgency=low

  * Use partman-basicfilesystems/mountpoint_manual rather than
    partman-uboot/mountpoint_manual; there's no need for a different
    template here, and it saves having to teach ubiquity about the extra one
    (LP: #462798).

partman-uboot (2.1) karmic; urgency=low

  * mkfs.ext2 with -I 128 and not -b 4096 as this is what Marvell recommends
    to work around a bug in older Uboots.

partman-uboot (2) karmic; urgency=low

  * debian/control:

partman-uboot (1) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Michael Casadevall ]
  * New package partman-uboot based on partman-ext2r0 which adds support
    for the creating a /boot partition as required by our boot system on
    u-boot based systems
  * ext2 filesystem formatted with -b 4096 as per Marvell's instructions

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add explicit subarchitecture checks to a few scripts. This does
    duplicate XB-Subarchitecture in debian/control, but it makes life easier
    for ubiquity.
