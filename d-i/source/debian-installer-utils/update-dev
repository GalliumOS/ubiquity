# Triggering causes udev to reprocess all events, as if it were coldplugging
# the system. In some cases this can be unnecessary (or even cause
# problems!), and all you really want to do is settle - i.e. make sure that
# udev is up-to-date with events that have already been generated. On the
# other hand, if you install new modules, as d-i sometimes does, then you
# need to trigger to make sure that events that couldn't be processed due to
# missing modules are reprocessed.
#
# Thus, we have two modes: 'update-dev' triggers reprocessing of all events
# and waits for that to finish, while 'update-dev --settle' just waits for
# events that are already pending to be handled by userspace.
