Description: system-wide keyboard preferences
 This package maintains the keyboard preferences in
 /etc/default/keyboard.  Other packages can use the information
 provided by this package in order to configure the keyboard on the
 console or in X Window.

Description: console font and keymap setup program
 This package provides the console with the same keyboard
 configuration scheme as the X Window System. As a result, there is no
 need to duplicate or change the keyboard files just to make simple
 customizations such as the use of dead keys, the key functioning as
 AltGr or Compose key, the key(s) to switch between Latin and
 non-Latin mode, etc.
 .
 The package also installs console fonts supporting many of the
 world's languages.  It provides an unified set of font faces - the
 classic VGA, the simplistic Fixed, and the cleaned Terminus,
 TerminusBold and TerminusBoldVGA.

Description: font converter to generate console fonts from BDF source fonts
 This package provides a command-line converter that can be used in
 scripts to build console fonts from BDF sources automatically. The
 converter comes with a collection of font encodings that cover many
 of the world's languages. The output font can use a different
 character encoding from the input. When the source font does not
 define a glyph for a particular symbol in the encoding table, that
 glyph position in the console font is not wasted but used for another
 symbol.
 .
 When deciding about the position in the font for a particular glyph,
 the converter takes into account that in text video modes the video
 adapter copies the eighth column of the glyph matrix of symbols
 positioned in the pseudographic area to the ninth column. In order to
 create fonts for text video modes, the width of the glyph matrix of
 the source BDF font should be seven, eight, or nine pixels; otherwise the
 converter creates fonts suitable for framebuffer only.
