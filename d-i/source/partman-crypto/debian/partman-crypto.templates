 This is a fatal error since sensitive data could be written out to

 recover parts of the encryption key or passphrase.

 Please disable the swap space (e.g. by running swapoff) or configure
 an encrypted swap space and then run setup of encrypted volumes again.
 This program will now abort.

# SECURITY NOTE
# -------------
# Starting with partman-crypto/77, 3 extra items can be preseeded:
#  - partman-crypto/passphrase
#  - partman-crypto/passphrase-again
#  - partman-crypto/weak_passphrase
#
# The security of the installed system depends on the preseed source.
# For example: The passphrase could easily be eavesdropped on a local
# network. A proper key escrow system might be a better idea.
Template: partman-crypto/passphrase
Type: password
# :sl3:
_Description: Encryption passphrase:
 You need to choose a passphrase to encrypt ${DEVICE}.
 .
 The overall strength of the encryption depends strongly on this
 passphrase, so you should take care to choose a passphrase that is
 not easy to guess. It should not be a word or sentence found in
 dictionaries, or a phrase that could be easily associated with you.
 .
 A good passphrase will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and
 punctuation. Passphrases are recommended to have a length of 20 or
 more characters.
 .
 There is no way to recover this passphrase if you lose it. To avoid
 losing data, you should normally write down the passphrase and keep it
 in a safe place separate from this computer.

Template: partman-crypto/passphrase-again

#flag:comment:2
# Translators: we unfortunately cannot use plural forms here

_Description: Use weak passphrase?
 You entered a passphrase that consists of less than ${MINIMUM} characters,
 which is considered too weak. You should choose a stronger passphrase.

Type: error
# :sl3:
_Description: Encryption configuration failure
 You have selected the root file system to be stored on an encrypted

 the kernel and initrd can be stored.
 .
 You should go back and setup a /boot partition.

Template: partman-crypto/crypto_boot_not_possible
Type: error
# :sl3:
_Description: Encryption configuration failure
 You have selected the /boot file system to be stored on an encrypted
 partition. This is not possible because the boot loader would be unable to
 load the kernel and initrd. Continuing now would result
 in an installation that cannot be used.
 .
 You should go back and choose a non-encrypted partition for the /boot
 file system.

Template: partman-crypto/use_random_for_nonswap
Type: boolean
Default: false
# :sl3:
_Description: Are you sure you want to use a random key?
 You have chosen a random key type for ${DEVICE} but requested the
 partitioner to create a file system on it.
 .
 Using a random key type means that the partition data is going to
 be destroyed upon each reboot. This should only be used for
 swap partitions.
