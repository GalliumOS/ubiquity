The files in this directory are updated automatically from the distribution
archive. Any changes you make under this directory will be lost!

New ubiquity-specific scripts should be added to scripts/ instead; you can
make local modifications here if you need to, but for inclusion in official
builds the changes need to be applied to the corresponding source packages
and uploaded.
