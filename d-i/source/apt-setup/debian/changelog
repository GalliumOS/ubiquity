apt-setup (1:0.104ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Install the Ubuntu mirror generator instead of Debian's.
    - Set apt-setup/security_host to security.ubuntu.com, or
      ports.ubuntu.com on ports architectures; adjust directory and
      distribution to match.
    - Add security sources for restricted, universe, and multiverse,
      commented out unless the respective components are enabled. Disable
      security generator checks for contrib and non-free.
    - For CD installs, leave the sources.list created by apt-setup in
      /etc/apt/sources.list.apt-setup, and restore the sources.list created
      during base installation for the rest of the installation.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_BASE_INSTALLABLE when checking
      /cdrom/.disk/base_installable.
    - Set the mirror verification timeout to 30 seconds.
    - Adjust services-select for Ubuntu, removing volatile and adding
      partner (apt-setup/partner) and extras (apt-setup/extras).
    - Always disable the CD at the end of installation if any mirrors are
      present, even if it's a complete CD.
    - Pre-populate apt's lists directory with signed Release files for
      archive.ubuntu.com (and mirrors) and security.ubuntu.com, to protect
      against downgrade attacks right from initial installation.
    - Run 'apt-get update' for all sources.list lines produced by a single
      generator in one go, and don't comment out sources.list lines if it
      fails.
    - Make the path to security updates configurable, as well as the host.
    - Remove restricted from cdrom entry if apt-setup/restricted is false.
    - Make sure apt-cdrom doesn't unmount the CD if cd_type ends with
      /single.
    - Enable all network sources, including security updates, even if the
      network is unconfigured.
    - Honour apt-setup/restricted, apt-setup/universe, and
      apt-setup/multiverse when writing -backports lines.
    - Run 'apt-get update', without downloading package lists or cleaning up
      old files, after moving the sources.list generated during base system
      installation back into place.
    - If OVERRIDE_LEAVE_CD_MOUNTED is set, don't unmount /cdrom; this is a
      bad idea in a live CD environment!
    - Enable backports by default now that we have NotAutomatic enabled and
      working.
    - Add Release files.
  * Replace saucy Release and Release.gpg files with those for xenial.

  * Stop enabling backports by default (Closes: #764982). Rationale:
     - Packages in the base suite are preferred to the ones in the
       backports suite so one needs to specifically ask for the version
       from backports.
     - That isn't true for packages which are only available in the
       backports suite.
    This means one could possibly install such packages without even
    noticing they're not fetched from the base suite; and that seems
    a dangerous default.

apt-setup (1:0.56ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Install the Ubuntu mirror generator instead of Debian's.
    - Set apt-setup/security_host to security.ubuntu.com, or
      ports.ubuntu.com on ports architectures; adjust directory and
      distribution to match.
    - Add security sources for restricted, universe, and multiverse,
      commented out unless the respective components are enabled. Disable
      security generator checks for contrib and non-free.
    - For CD installs, leave the sources.list created by apt-setup in
      /etc/apt/sources.list.apt-setup, and restore the sources.list created
      during base installation for the rest of the installation.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_BASE_INSTALLABLE when checking
      /cdrom/.disk/base_installable.
    - Set the mirror verification timeout to 30 seconds.
    - Adjust services-select for Ubuntu, removing volatile and adding
      partner (apt-setup/partner) and extras (apt-setup/extras).
    - Always disable the CD at the end of installation if any mirrors are
      present, even if it's a complete CD.
    - Pre-populate apt's lists directory with signed Release files for
      archive.ubuntu.com (and mirrors) and security.ubuntu.com, to protect
      against downgrade attacks right from initial installation.
    - Run 'apt-get update' for all sources.list lines produced by a single
      generator in one go, and don't comment out sources.list lines if it
      fails.
    - Make the path to security updates configurable, as well as the host.
    - Remove restricted from cdrom entry if apt-setup/restricted is false.
    - Make sure apt-cdrom doesn't unmount the CD if cd_type ends with
      /single.
    - Enable all network sources, including security updates, even if the
      network is unconfigured.
    - Honour apt-setup/restricted, apt-setup/universe, and
      apt-setup/multiverse when writing -backports lines.
    - Run 'apt-get update', without downloading package lists or cleaning up
      old files, after moving the sources.list generated during base system
      installation back into place.
    - If OVERRIDE_LEAVE_CD_MOUNTED is set, don't unmount /cdrom; this is a
      bad idea in a live CD environment!
    - Bail out cleanly from cdrom generator if /cdrom/.disk/info doesn't
      exist or has zero size.
    - Enable backports by default now that we have NotAutomatic enabled and
      working.
    - If apt-setup/multiarch is empty, remove
      /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch.
  * Add Release files for quantal, and remove those for precise (except for
    extras.ubuntu.com, where quantal doesn't exist yet).

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Install the Ubuntu mirror generator instead of Debian's.
    - Set apt-setup/security_host to security.ubuntu.com, or
      ports.ubuntu.com on ports architectures; adjust directory and
      distribution to match.
    - Add security sources for restricted, universe, and multiverse,
      commented out unless the respective components are enabled. Disable
      security generator checks for contrib and non-free.
    - For CD installs, leave the sources.list created by apt-setup in
      /etc/apt/sources.list.apt-setup, and restore the sources.list created
      during base installation for the rest of the installation.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_BASE_INSTALLABLE when checking
      /cdrom/.disk/base_installable.
    - Set the mirror verification timeout to 30 seconds.
    - Disable the volatile service for Ubuntu, and don't ask the
      apt-setup/services-select question.
    - Always disable the CD at the end of installation if any mirrors are
      present, even if it's a complete CD.
    - Pre-populate apt's lists directory with signed Release files for
      archive.ubuntu.com (and mirrors) and security.ubuntu.com, to protect
      against downgrade attacks right from initial installation.
    - Run 'apt-get update' for all sources.list lines produced by a single
      generator in one go, and don't comment out sources.list lines if it
      fails.
    - Make the path to security updates configurable, as well as the host.
    - Remove restricted from cdrom entry if apt-setup/restricted is false.
    - Allow preseeding apt-setup/partner to enable the partner repository,
      and apt-setup/extras to enable extras.ubuntu.com.
    - Make sure apt-cdrom doesn't unmount the CD if cd_type ends with
      /single.
    - Enable all network sources, including security updates, even if the
      network is unconfigured.
    - Honour apt-setup/restricted, apt-setup/universe, and
      apt-setup/multiverse when writing -backports lines.
    - Check to make sure the CD filesystem is iso9660 before remounting it
      as such.  Do not write a CD identifier if we're not working with
      iso9660 so pkgsel does not try to unmount such disks.
    - Run 'apt-get update', without downloading package lists or cleaning up
      old files, after moving the sources.list generated during base system
      installation back into place.
    - If OVERRIDE_LEAVE_CD_MOUNTED is set, don't unmount /cdrom; this is a
      bad idea in a live CD environment!
    - Bail out cleanly from cdrom generator if /cdrom/.disk/info doesn't
      exist or has zero size.
  * Add Release files for natty.
  * Move partner and extras to the services-select framework, customised for
    Ubuntu (LP: #657176).

apt-setup (1:0.48) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set LC_ALL=C when calling 'apt-cdrom ident', since we parse its output.
    Broken by the change in 1:0.47 to use chroot-setup.sh, which sets LANG.
  * Ask apt-setup/cdrom/media-change at critical priority, since we'll enter
    an infinite loop if it isn't presented (thanks, Petter Reinholdtsen;
    closes: #598457).

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * When cdrom-detect/hybrid is true, the CD is not mountable by apt,
    so behave the same as for a hd-media install.
  * Needs cdrom-detect 1.35.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use chroot-setup.sh to mount /proc and /sys in the target when running
    apt-cdrom (closes: #595903).  This would normally need di-utils 1.80;
    but to avoid breaking d-i squeeze alpha 1 (and possibly beta 1) initrds,
    I've temporarily copied a chunk of code from chroot-setup.sh into two
    apt-setup generator scripts.  This should be cleaned up once
    compatibility with older initrds is no longer necessary.

  * Guard against future multiple-CD handling changes in apt.  If multiple

    - Pre-populate apt's lists directory with signed Release files for
      archive.ubuntu.com (and mirrors) and security.ubuntu.com, to protect
      against downgrade attacks right from initial installation.
    - Run 'apt-get update' for all sources.list lines produced by a single

      fails.
    - Make the path to security updates configurable, as well as the host.
    - Remove restricted from cdrom entry if apt-setup/restricted is false.
    - Add Release files for intrepid and jaunty.
    - Make sure to exit services-select generator cleanly if
      apt-setup/services-select is empty.
    - Allow preseeding apt-setup/partner to enable the partner repository.
    - Use cdrom-detect/cdrom_fs when remounting the CD to ensure that we do
      so using the same filesystem.
    - Make sure apt-cdrom doesn't unmount the CD if cd_type ends with
      /single.
    - Enable all network sources, including security updates, even if the
      network is unconfigured.
    - Fix handling of universe and multiverse in -backports lines.
    - Honour apt-setup/restricted, apt-setup/universe, and
      apt-setup/multiverse when writing -backports lines.
    - Check to make sure the CD filesystem is iso9660 before remounting it
      as such.  Do not write a CD identifier if we're not working with
      iso9660 so pkgsel does not try to unmount such disks.
    - Fix description of universe in generated sources.list: packages there
      are expected to be under a free licence.
    - Run 'apt-get update', without downloading package lists or cleaning up
      old files, after moving the sources.list generated during base system
      installation back into place.
    - If OVERRIDE_LEAVE_CD_MOUNTED is set, don't unmount /cdrom; this is a
      bad idea in a live CD environment!
    - Bail out cleanly from cdrom generator if /cdrom/.disk/info doesn't
      exist or has zero size.
  * Dropped changes, merged in Debian:
    - Initialise local variable 'file' so that apt-setup-verify doesn't get
      excruciatingly confused when you pass file=/path on the kernel command
      line.

apt-setup (1:0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Add support for CD/DVD sets during installation:
    - rename generator 50cdrom to 40cdrom to make room for new generator
    - add new generator 41cdset to support scanning additional CD/DVDs
    - add script load-install-cd
    To support CD/DVD changing, the installation CD/DVD needs to be unmounted
    in the D-I environment during package installation, which means that e.g.
    running anna-install to install udebs is no longer possible. Because of
    this components/scripts also need make sure that the installation CD is
    loaded and mounted again after package installation.
    Components/scripts that can install packages in /target after apt-setup
    has been run should either use apt-install, or create the correct
    conditions themselves (as pkgsel does).
    Requires apt (0.7.9) in testing for #448187 and #448521, and requires
    pkgsel (1.16) and di-utils (1.50).
  * Add myself as uploader.

      /etc/apt/sources.list.apt-setup, and restore the sources.list created
      during base installation for the rest of the installation.

apt-setup (1:0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * First release as a udeb broken out from base-config and rewritten.

  * This means that apt mirror config uses d-i's mirror configs automatically.
    Closes: #220269, #252121, #235980, #251007
  * Issues with /dev/cdrom symlinks no longer apply, since that's taken
    care of by d-i. Closes: #198759, #264375, #274615
  * Issues with CD eject buttons no longer apply, since well, it currently
    only supports loading in one CD. Closes: #215639, #215639, #240331
    Closes: #333513
    (TODO item exists for multiple CDs tho).
  * Runs in the first stage so no issues with it running again and eating
    configured sources or wanting to clear proxy settings.
    Closes: #229048, #196625
  * Will deal nicely with failure to reach security.debian.org.
    Closes: #251413
  * You can enter a mirror manually in choose-mirror and entry proxy info too.
    Closes: #277481, #284794
  * CD stuff works ok in noninteractive/preseeded modes. Closes: #282356
  * Adds deb-src lines for everything, including security updates.
    Closes: #269154.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Various small fixes.
  * Call the main package apt-setup-udeb to allow for apt-setup.deb in the
    future.
  * Add translation infrastructure.
  * Set epoch to supersede the base-config-based apt-setup-udeb in Ubuntu.
  * Don't bother looking for security updates for unstable.
  * Strip everything after the first dot from generator names when
    constructing progress template names, to allow writing variants of a
    generator with the same basic purpose as the original.
  * Initial untested mirror generator for Ubuntu. Not added to translation
    infrastructure yet, although the templates are there.
