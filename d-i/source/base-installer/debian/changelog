  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Use and depend on the Ubuntu keyring.
    - Enable the restricted component by default, unless
      apt-setup/restricted is preseeded to false.
    - Set up the default sources.list to look in -updates and -security (the
      latter from apt-setup/security_host and apt-setup/security_path) as
      well as the unadorned suite; also -proposed if apt-setup/proposed is
      true.
    - Use Ubuntu kernel image names.
    - Allow preseeding base-installer/kernel/override-image to force a given
      kernel to be used.
    - Install busybox-initramfs rather than busybox.
    - Revert Joey's patch to call base-installer.d hooks after running
      debootstrap, which broke console-setup's expectation of being able to
      insert its configuration file into /target before console-setup is
      installed by debootstrap.
    - Add armhf/keystone, armhf/omap, and armhf/omap4 subarchitectures.
    - Install kernel headers to match the kernel. This may be overridden by
      setting base-installer/kernel/headers to false.
    - Add base-installer/kernel/backports-modules template, which may be
      preseeded to install selected linux-backports-modules-* packages.
    - Move some kernel installation support code from bootstrap-base to
      base-installer, and allow live-installer to override the title
      template used by that.
    - Add powerpc/e500 and powerpc/e500mc subarchitectures.
    - Add overlay archive support.
    - Add arm64 and ppc64el architectures.

  * Add support for different initramfs generators, allowing different
    defaults per architecture. If there are multiple values, allow the
    user to select one (depending on priority).
  * Enable initramfs generation for hppa.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Rework initramfs templates, remove the clumsy "initramfs initrd"
    construct; the fact that it's an initramfs is essentially an
    implementation detail that users do not need to worry about.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Move post install hooks to run after debootstrap but before the
    installation of the kernel and other extra packages. This allows
    this hook to be used for preseeding packages installed after debootstrap.
  * Avoid crashing the postinst if arch_get_kernel_flavour fails, this better
    supports the case of some unknown subarch since later tests will result
    in a warning message being shown to the user about there being no usable
    kernel.
  * Add guards around uses of FLAVOUR in case above change makes it be empty

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove mkinitrd.conf hacking code that worked around bugs in the woody
    version, not supported by this version of d-i.

  [ Frans Pop ]

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Re-implement the use of log-output using the new version written in C.
  * Remove hard-coded redirection to /var/log/messages in run-debootstrap so
    that log-output in the postinst can do its work.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove code that munged/demunged Packages and Release filename in the
    cache for debootstrap, since debootstrap no longer does that munging.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Use a cdrom: source line in apt instead of a file: source line to make
    apt's TrustCDROM option actually work. Make sure sources.list is empty
    before running apt-cdrom.
  * Make sure that neither apt-cdrom or apt unount/mount CD-ROMs; needed to
    make cdrom: source lines also work with CD images.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Display fallback warning messages as using an error template instead
    of in the progress bar, since they can be arbitrarily bad. Warnings that
    have a template (ie, the download retry warning) still display as progress
    bar updates.
  * Delete any cruft left behind by a past debootstrap run in
    /target/var/lib/apt. This avoids a problem where 1) debootstrap is run
    before dinstall 2) Packages file download fails and aborts the run 3)
    debootstrap is re-run after dinstall, does not refresh Release file, and
    fails since the new Packages file it does download has a m5sum mismatch
    with the old Release file. (Ah, the joys of running d-i on dialup..)

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * Adapted to chrp_rs6k -> chrp_ibm migration.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix code to avoid -smp variants on powerpc64.
  * Support configuring initramfs-tools rather than initrd-tools, and make
    that the default when installing 2.6. We still use initrd-tools on hppa
    and ia64, as the most current information I have indicates that
    initramfs-tools doesn't work there; porters should feel free to update
    this. I've left notes for where I think yaird could best be slotted in.
  * Allow extra packages to be installed along with init*-tools, controlled
    by base-installer/kernel/linux/extra-packages* templates. This allows
    derivatives to install initramfs hooks such as usplash.

      bar. However, this is untested, since debootstrap's warning code is
      a bit broken (bug filed).
    - Add warning template for the only currently useful warning, for retrying
      a failed download.
    - Build run-debootstrap with -Os and -fomit-frame-pointer.
    - Try to keep base system dependency issues from breaking the installer
      by passing --resolve-deps to debootstrap. Aj recommends we turn this
      back off before stable releases though.
    - Avoid some hardcoded paths.
    - Remove some unnecessary functions that just thunk to other arch-specific
      functions.

    - Redirect output from base-installer hooks properly.
    - Clarify and expand base-installer/debootstrap/error/couldntdl text to
      try to answer frequent problems such as badly burned CDs.
    - Add a post-base-installation hook: scripts in
      /usr/lib/post-base-installer.d/ will be run after the base system
      installation is complete. This allows locales to be created earlier,
      thereby silencing warnings from code that chroots into /target before
      prebaseconfig runs.
    - Use C-style comments in run-debootstrap.
    - List both starting and ending percentages for waypoints, in order to
      be able to support multiple paths in the event of changes to
      debootstrap.
    - Add necessary waypoints and strings to cope with the debootstrap
      granularity patch (#244563).
    - Work out the largest swap partition, if any, and use its devfs-mapped
      name as the value of RESUME= in /etc/mkinitrd/mkinitrd.conf.

    - Bump kernel defaults to 2.4.27-2 and 2.6.8-2 for i386, ia64, and s390.
      hppa is still trailing behind at 2.6.8-1.
    - Use major version of target kernel rather than installation kernel to
      work out whether to use an initrd or (on powerpc) to run mkvmlinuz.
    - Parameterise access to files in /proc by kernel/*.sh, allowing the
      test suite to run without sudo access or a chroot. 'make test' in
      kernel/ should be easily runnable by everyone now.
    - If run with TEST_VERBOSE=0, the test suite produces no output except
      on errors.
    - kernel/tests/runtests and 'make test' in kernel/ exit non-zero on

    - 2.4.27-3 powerpc kernel now produces only one kernel-image-2.4.27-powerpc
      package, so dropped the pmac/chrp/chrp-rs6k/prep handling from
      kernel/powerpc.sh.
    - Removed mkvmlinuz explicit install, as all kernel-images (2.4.27-3,
      2.6.8-11 and 2.6.10-3) now depend on mkvmlinuz.

    - Remove downmainpkgs stuff; only used for slink deboostrapping.
    - Switch over to a single, milti-stage progress bar for the entire
      debootstrap run.
    - Fixed typo that was preventing build with -Os.
    - Remove the basesuccess note.
    - Incorporated the apt setup and install steps into the same single
      progress bar.
    - Merged kernel-installer into base-installer so they can share a progress
      bar.
    - Updated to debhelper v4.
    - Cleaned up the rules file.
    - Remove Standards-Version, it's a udeb.
    - Added some error templates left out due to the string freeze.
    - Stop the progress bar when exiting on debootstrap error.
    - busybox does provide uniq and sort -r now, so remove the dodgy calls to
      the ones in /target.
    - Move the apt-install queue flush to after kernel installation.
      This way, if apt-install is used to install the kernel image and pcmcia
      modules and they fail to install for some reason, and end up in the
      apt-install queue, this does not result in apt-install installing them
      when the kernel-image.conf is not properly set up.
    - Refactored most of the code in the postinst, breaking it up into
      subroutines for clarity.
    - Use only one exit point for errors, and always stop the progress bar.
    - apt-update is only used by this package, so inline it.
    - Remove some debootstrap errors which should never appear during normal
      (or abnormal) use unless d-i is very broken from the templates file, no
      need to watse time and space on translations of them.
