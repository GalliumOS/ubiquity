* If ftp or http isn't turned on, we can trim down the templates file..
  Or, if cdebconf supports registration, I could just collapse the more or
  less duplicate ftp and http templates into one, and register multiple
  questions from it. Which is probably best..
* Grab country names translations at build time by using the iso_3166
  translations from the iso-codes package. See countrychooser mechanism
  for this. Will save useless work to translators.
* Dynamically build list of suites on a mirror and let the user choose
  between them, instead of choosing from a static list that might be wrong.
  (The question is, where to get translated descriptions of the available
  suites? Or would a list of suite names w/o descriptions be ok as the
  question only shows up in expert mode?)
* Now that the mirror split has happened, some work needs to be done on
  default mirrors. The current default of ftp.debian.org is not available
  for some arches, and those arches will get a semi-randomly determined
  default. Possible solutions include:

    - Using ftp.debian.org/debian-all , but this would best be aliased to
      ftp-all.debian.org due to limitations of Mirrors.masterlist format.
    - Using the mirrors.debian.net dns infrastructure, if it's reads.
