    - Set priority for get_domain to high for static configurations.
    - Set priority for get_domain to medium for non-static configurations.
    - Use 'auto <interface>' for all interfaces, dropping allow-hotplug

    - Set DHCP and DHCPv6 timeout to 30s.
    - Use isc-dhcp-client-udeb on all architectures.
    - Flush all addresses and routes before configuring interfaces

    - Don't copy /etc/resolv.conf to target if resolvconf is installed.  (We
      already write resolvconf configuration to /etc/network/interfaces.)
    - Add a post-base-install hook to detect resolvconf and copy
      /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf to outside the target so that when /run is
      bind-mounted DNS resolving continues to work. (LP: #926447)
    - Apply patch from Alec Warner making netcfg respect
      netcfg/dhcpv6_timeout and running dhclient in one-shot mode (-1).
      (LP: #917905)
    - Fix FTBFS by checking the return value of fgets and fscanf.
    - Fix nm-conf to generate a valid NetworkManager static configuration

    - Always allow fe80::/64 for the default gateway. (LP: #1382295)

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Set default hostname to 'ubuntu'.
    - Drop priority of netcfg/get_domain to medium for non-static
      configurations.
    - Use 'auto <interface>' for all interfaces, dropping allow-hotplug
      which doesn't work with current udev.
    - Call /usr/lib/network-manager/ifblacklist_migrate.sh from
      finish-install if present, so that 'auto dhcp' interfaces are disabled
      if network-manager is in use. May be preseeded away with
      netcfg/network-manager.
    - Bump the DHCP timeout to 30 seconds.

    sysfs-update-devnames had not been fixed to look in

  [ Thomas Hood ]
  * If there is no permanent IP address with which the system hostname
    (i.e., that which is returned by the "hostname" command) can be
    associated in /etc/hosts then associate it with address 127.0.1.1
    rather than 127.0.0.1.  Associating the system hostname with the
    latter had the unwanted effect of making 'localhost.localdomain'
    the canonical hostname associated with the system hostname.
    That is, 'hostname --fqdn' returned 'localhost.localdomain'.
    (Closes: #316099)
    Programs that access local services at the IP address obtained by
    resolving the system hostname SHOULD NOT DO THIS, but those that
    do so will not be disappointed: most services that listen locally
    listen on all 127/8 addresses, not just on 127.0.0.1.

netcfg (1.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Ask netcfg/get_nameservers at priority critical; if you're doing
      static network configuration, you probably need to be asked this.
  * Joshua Kwan
    - Rip out mii-diag support. Incidentally, this closes the 'Go Back'
      bugs regarding a template that now no longer exists.
      (Closes: #269081, #269236)
    - Code consolidation - don't duplicate the code that writes resolv.conf
  * Thomas Hood
    - Change function of backup button from netcfg/dhcp_options so that
      instead of causing an exit from netcfg it backs up to the
      choose-interface question (if there is more than one interface)
      (Closes: #269081)
  * Joey Hess
    - Remove mii-diag-udeb dependencies, which were bogus even before mii-diag
      support was removed.
    - Allow netcfg/choose_interface to be preseeded to just an interface name,
      don't choke on the lack of a colon after it.

    - Remove XSIisms in dhclient-script.
    - Evaluate argv[0] after calling basename on it so that we can strcmp it

      context, but appeared during testing in the shell.
    - Add Thomas Hood to Uploaders.
    - Re-enable broadcast stuff in dhclient-script, fixing a Sparc (at least)
      regression.
    - Remove kill_dhcp_client prototype from netcfg.h because it's now static.
    - Change newline + a space to just a newline to end some disable_dhcp
      woes.
    - Warn if there's no default route available after getting a DHCP lease.

      used.
    - Remove udhcpc support in dhcp.c.

      have been rather neglected lately.
    - Fix the GO_BACK interaction between WEP and ESSID configuration.

    - Display a brief note when DHCP lease gets acquired. (Closes: #247751)
    - Now we can ask for a DHCP hostname to add. (Closes: #236533, #239591)
    - If we didn't use one, see if the server is offering us one and seed
      netcfg/get_hostname with it. (Closes: #239121, #240701)
    - Failing that, bring the interface up and try to reverse-resolve
      the IP address into a hostname.
    - For idempotency reasons, down all interfaces after finding each
      one so that we can start from a clean slate. (Probably deals with
      Bug#227722)
    - Silently load af_packet. (Closes: #244441)
    - Add some code hunks from mii-diag to determine code path on link
      connection. (Closes: #247178)
    - Add some interface_up and interface_down functions.
    - Fix a long standing bug in devnames retrieval that did not strip
      newlines from the devnames input and caused cdebconf to screw
      up on subsequent questions.
    - Bump the DHCP wait to 15 seconds. The magic number seems to be just
      over 10 for me. (Closes: #244819)
    - Template cleanups: netcfg/static-title, netcfg/dhcp-title,
      netcfg/internal-pcmcia, netcfg/confirm_dhcp
    - Add dhcp3-client support. Not that it actually gets used now that
      we can get a DHCP-supplied hostname from dhcp-client.
    - Remove a lot of calls to /sbin/this and /sbin/that in response to Joey's
      rant on debian-boot.
