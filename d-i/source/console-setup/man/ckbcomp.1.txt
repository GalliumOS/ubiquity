CKBCOMP(1)                Console-setup User's Manual               CKBCOMP(1)



NAME
       ckbcomp  -  compile a XKB keyboard description to a keymap suitable for
       loadkeys or kbdcontrol


SYNOPSIS
       ckbcomp [OPTION...] [XKBLAYOUT [XKBVARIANT [XKBOPTIONS]...]]


DESCRIPTION
       The ckbcomp keymap compiler converts a description of an  XKB  keyboard
       layout  into  a console keymap that can be read directly by loadkeys(1)
       or kbdcontrol(1).

       On its standard output ckbcomp dumps the generated keyboard definition.
       The most important difference between the arguments of setxkbmap(1) and
       the arguments of ckbcomp is the additional parameter -charmap when non-
       Unicode keyboard map is wanted.  Without -charmap ckbcomp will generate
       Unicode keyboard.



OPTIONS
   General options
       -?,-help
              Print a usage message and exit.

       -charmap charmap
              The encoding to use for the output keymap.  There should  be  an
              character    mapping    table    defining   this   encoding   in
              /usr/local/share/consoletrans.   Definitions  of  the  following
              charmaps   are  provided:  ARMSCII-8,  CP1251,  CP1255,  CP1256,
              GEORGIAN-ACADEMY, GEORGIAN-PS, IBM1133, ISIRI-3342,  ISO-8859-1,
              ISO-8859-2,   ISO-8859-3,  ISO-8859-4,  ISO-8859-5,  ISO-8859-6,
              ISO-8859-7, ISO-8859-8,  ISO-8859-9,  ISO-8859-10,  ISO-8859-11,
              ISO-8859-13,   ISO-8859-14,  ISO-8859-15,  ISO-8859-16,  KOI8-R,
              KOI8-U, TIS-620 and VISCII.


       -Idir  Look in the top-level directory dir for files  included  by  the
              keymap description.  This option may be used multiple times.  If
              a file can not be found in any of the specified directories,  it
              will  be searched also in some other standard locations, such as
              /usr/local/etc/console-setup/ckb,  /usr/local/share/X11/xkb  and
              /etc/X11/xkb


       -v level
              Set  level  of detail for listing.  The argument level must be a
              number from 1 to 10.

       -compact
              Generate a compact keymap with at most two xkb  groups  and  two
              levels in each or only one xkb-group and up to four levels.

       -freebsd
              Generate a keymap for FreeBSD.

       -backspace [bs|del]
              Specifies  the  behaviour  of the <BackSpace> and <Delete> keys.
              Value bs specifies VT100-conformant behaviour: <BackSpace>  will
              generate  ^H  (ASCII  BS)  and <Delete> will generate ^?  (ASCII
              DEL).    Value   del   specifies   VT220-conformant    behavior:
              <BackSpace> will generate ^?  (ASCII DEL) and <Delete> will gen-
              erate a special function sequence.


   XKB Keyboard Description
       The keyboard layout, variant and options components can be also  speci-
       fied directly on the command line.  See the synopsis of the command.

       -symbols name
              Specifies  the  symbols  component  name of the XKB keyboard de-
              scription.

       -keycodes name
              Specifies the keycodes component name of the  XKB  keyboard  de-
              scription.

       -rules name
              The name of the rules file to use.

       -model name
              Specifies the keyboard model used to choose the component names.

       -layout name
              Specifies the layout used to choose the component names.

       -variant name
              Specifies the layout variant used to choose the component names.

       -option name
              Adds an option used to choose component names.


FILES
       /usr/local/share/consoletrans
       /usr/local/etc/console-setup/ckb
       /usr/share/X11/xkb
       /etc/X11/xkb


NOTES
       If  the  option -freebsd is used together with -backspace del, then the
       key <Delete> will generate the special code fkey70.  It is your respon-
       sibility  to  assign  the appropriate sequence to this special  code by
       using the following command:

           kbdcontrol -f 70 "`printf '\033[3~'`"
