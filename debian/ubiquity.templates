_Description:
 You have chosen to enable third-party software as part of your install,
 which for this system includes hardware drivers for graphics and/or wi-fi
 hardware. Your system also has UEFI Secure Boot enabled. UEFI Secure Boot
 is not compatible with the use of these third-party drivers.
 .
 After installation completes, Ubuntu will assist you in disabling UEFI
 Secure Boot. To ensure that this change is being made by you as an authorized
 user, and not by an attacker, you must choose a password now and then use
 the same password after reboot to confirm the change.
 .
 <span foreground="darkred">Warning</span>: If you choose not to install
 these drivers, or if you proceed but do not confirm the password upon reboot,
 Ubuntu will still be able to boot on your system but these third-party
 drivers will not be available for your hardware.
