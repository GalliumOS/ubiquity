partman-auto (134ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    Recipe changes:
    - Adjust default partition and EFI sizes for Ubuntu.
    - Change the x86 atomic recipes to make the minimum swap size be 100% of
      RAM, so that hibernate always works.
    - In addition to EFI partition, reuse existing swap partitions and
      BIOS Boot Partitions, if any, rather than creating new ones.
    - Use fat32 rather than free as a filesystem type for the efi partitions
      for amd64, arm64, i386; otherwise it's seen as an ext2 partition by
      partman-efi, which causes errors or missing settings.

    Automatic Partitioning:
    - Offer resize_use_free autopartitioning method, except on armel/armhf.
    - Add an option to reuse an existing installation.
    - Split out the replace option from resize_use_free.

    Code changes:
    - Accept autopartitioning automatically rather than showing
      choose_partition.
    - Drop priority of partman-auto/choose_recipe question to medium.
    - Add support for partman-auto/method=loop via partman-auto-loop.
    - Make biggest_free respect the selection made in partman-auto/disk.
    - Exclude devices containing the installation medium from automatic
      partitioning.
    - Use new get_real_resize_range function from partman-partitioning
      72ubuntu3, which caches calls to tune2fs and ntfsresize.
    - Support resizing the largest partition on multiple disks.
    - Support formatting the entire partition for any partition that can be
      resized.
  * Double minimum and maximum sizes for the /boot partitions on amd64, i386,
    and arm (especially for EFI). (LP: #1465050)

  * Update partition layout defaults:
    - atomic:
      - Set minimimum size of / partition to 900 MB for platforms without
        separate /boot partition and to 800 MB for those with /boot.
    - home:
      - Increase maximum size of / partition to 20 GB or 30 GB, depending
        on the platform.
      - Increase minimum size of / partition to 1500 MB and of /home to
        1000 MB.  This allocates more space to the / partition on smaller
        disks and ensures the separate /home option is not offered on 2 GB
        disks.
      - Increase priority of / partition so more space is allocated to it
        on small disks.  Closes: #770032
    - multi:
      - Increase maximum size of / partition to 25 GB.  Closes: #725642
      - Increase maximum size of /var partition to 10 GB.  Closes: #803604
      - Increase maximum size of /tmp partition to 2 GB.
      - Increase minimum size of / partition to 2000 MB, of /var to 1000 MB,
        of /tmp to 256 MB and of /home to 4000 MB.  This ensures that this
        option is no longer offered on 4 GB disks.
      - Increase priority of /home partition since most space should be
        allocated to it.
      - Increase priority of /tmp partition so more than the minimum is
        allocated to it.
      - Adjust priority of / partition in relation to other partitions.

    - Offer resize_use_free autopartitioning method, except on armel/armhf.
    - Add support for partman-auto/method=loop via partman-auto-loop.

    - Change the x86 atomic recipes to make the minimum swap size be 100% of

    - Add an option to reuse an existing installation.

    - Signal to clear_partitions in partman-target that it should not notify
      the user about the unformatted partitions we have set up.

    - Reuse existing swap partitions, BIOS Boot Partitions, and EFI System
      Partitions, if any, rather than creating new ones.
    - Increase minimum size of EFI System Partitions to 100MB.
    - Add a hack to stop EFI System Partitions showing up as to-be-formatted

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Remove explicit $primary{ } specifiers from standard recipes. We only
      need them to be primary if no other primary partitions exist already.
  * Change expert recipe error message to focus on the available disk space
    being too small, not the recipe being too large (idea from "Rorschach",
    LP: #415488).

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Remove no longer needed Lintian override for missing Standards-Version
    field.
  * After choosing "biggest free" option followed by backing up from the recipe
    dialog, don't exit to main menu but return to initial partman-auto dialog.

partman-auto (89ubuntu7) lucid; urgency=low

  * Run clean_method before starting autopartitioning instead of in the
    middle of performing a recipe, and call autopartition just once for
    multi-disk partitioning.  This means that methods applied to partitions
    of physical disks in RAID recipes are applied to all disks rather than
    just the last one (LP: #566965).

partman-auto (87ubuntu3) karmic; urgency=low

  * Added dove partman-auto support; dove is almost identical to kirkwood as
    it's a uboot based SoC and requires a dedicated boot partition. /boot as
    an ext2 partition may be replaced in the near future with a uboot
    partition type similar to how EFI is currently implemented for ia64.
    - Defaults for the /boot partition are 128M min, 256M max.

partman-auto (87) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for writing sizes as a number plus a percentage of RAM, e.g.
    "2000+50%". This is useful when doing automatic partitioning with the
    expectation of creating swap files.
  * If we're creating primary partitions and find that we've reached the end
    of the recipe, use "full" rather than "beginning" as the place passed to
    NEW_PARTITION, thereby avoiding rounding problems and matching the
    process for creating logical partitions (closes: #516347, LP: #287571).

partman-auto (73ubuntu4) hardy; urgency=low

  * Ensure that there is always at least one primary partition after
    autopartitioning. An existing primary partition on the disk satisfies
    this, as does a recipe partition explicitly marked $primary{ }; if
    neither of those exists, then arbitrarily promote the first recipe
    partition to be a primary partition.
  * Remove explicit $primary{ } specifiers from standard recipes. We only
    need them to be primary if no other primary partitions exist already.
  * Relax auto-resize constraints now that a primary partition is not
    unconditionally required; this will allow auto-resize partitioning on
    systems that already have three primary partitions (LP: #134950).

  * Moved definitions.sh to ./lib/base.sh.
  * Move recipes.sh and auto-shared.sh to ./lib/.
  * auto-shared.sh: rename wipe_disk() to auto_init_disk().
  * Use functions provided by partman-partitioning in auto_init_disk():
    - use the create_new_label function; don't prompt for disk label to use
      unless the default is invalid
    - create_new_label will now take care of removing existing LVM data from
      the selected device; the actual code to erase existing LVM data has been
      moved to partman-lvm
    Changes inspired by and partially based on a patch proposed in #396023 by
    JÃ©rÃ©my Bobbio.
  * Major whitespace cleanup and some coding style improvements.
  * Requires: partman-base (>= 114); partman-partitioning (>= 54).

  * choose_partition/auto/do_option: Improve ask_user exit code handling as
    follows: 255 is backup, so return to the choose_partition menu (rather
    than propagating 255 and thus backing up all the way to the d-i main

    skip the manual partitioner, assuming that it was running from the
    initial auto.d pass, but this doesn't make sense if the manual

  * Also set free_type in wipe_disk as that is needed by the function
    create_primary_partitions. This allows partman-auto-lvm to actually create
    the /boot partition as a primary partition.
  * Allow to include definitions of partitions in regular recipes that should
    only be used for a certain type of auto partitioning. This is useful to
    allow e.g. a definition for a /boot partition to be included that is not
    to be used for regular auto partitioning, but is needed for auto-lvm.
    The actual implementation is in reverse as that seems more flexible: a
    partition can be marked using "$<type>ignore" (where <type> is default or
    lvm) and will then not be included. Multiple ignore marks are possible.
    To implement this, the functions choose_recipe and decode_recipe now take
    an extra argument indicating the type of autopartitioning being done.

    (See http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2005/10/msg00842.html)
  * Add lvmok{ } to recipes as per discussion on debian-boot mailing list.
    NOTES:
      - nobody objected to a tag/properties/flag name or proposed something
        different. It is clearly ok to rename it if it doesn't fit.
      - swap will stay out of LVM for now. In some cases it is known to break
        suspend/resume. It seems not all kernels are able to resume from it.
      - porters will have to adjust their recipes. I could only test
        i386/amd64 (via recipes) and powerpc-powermac_newworld (via
        recipes-powerpc-powermac_newworld).
  * Move common code into auto-shared.sh shelllib and create 3 functions:
    wipe_disk, create_primary_partitions (see comments in the file) and
    create_partitions.
  * Install auto-shared.sh in /lib/partman (chages debian/rules)
  * Make perform_recipe and autopartition use auto-shared.sh.
  * Make create_partitions set a var for all the devices that will be marked
    as pv. This is actually only used by partman-auto-lvm, but it is generic
    enough that could be used later on for other tasks.
    NOTES: the above changes have been tested on i386/amd64/ppc and there is
    no known breakage. The code is only moved around and none of the actual
    recipes use method{ lvm } used by partman-auto-lvm to mark partitions as
    pv volumes.

  libparted did grow a C/H/S sanity check in disk_sun.c. While this is a sane

  Since we are in deep feature freeze, there is no time to make a proper fix
  into parted_server (that needs to be propagated all the way and back to

  * Move 2 chunks of code from perform_recipe into recipes.sh and make them
    functions. This code is shared with partman-auto-lvm so there is very
    little point in duplicating it.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use 'rm -f' rather than more awkward test-then-remove constructions.

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * Adapted to chrp_rs6k -> chrp_ibm transition.

      partman 40ubuntu1.
    - Accept autopartitioning automatically.

    - The root partition on powerpc/powermac_newworld shouldn't be bootable.
    - There's never any point in making the newworld bootstrap partition

  * Christian Perrier
    - Change minimum filesystem sizes for multi_user recipes
      This involved increasing the minimum size for / from 30 to 70
      because a Debian base system installs 48MB on / for i386
      Same limits used for other arches. Closes: #249786

      (mipsel/cobalt): copy the existing recipes, but add a boot partition
      with an ext2 revision 0 file system.  closes: #244100

    - templates: use the word "wizard" instead of automatic partitioning
    - add a "multi-user" recipe with compliance with the instructions in
      the install manual.  Sometimes inexperienced people have to install
      and administer such systems...
    - convert properly smaller than 10 bytes sizes to megabytes.
    - rules: remove .svn directories from the package
    - init.d/initial_auto: the <back> button exits partman.  Thanks to
      Blars Blarson, closes: #240411.
    - autopartitioning, automatically_partition/some_device/do_option: the
      synopsis of menudir_default_choice has changed
    - change the recipes to be in accordance with recent changes in partman:
        1. create files `use_filesystem' in partition directories with
           assigned file system
        2. linux-swap is not a file system but method
  * Joshua Kwan
    - switch to new debhelper udeb support
  * Joey Hess
    - Template polishing. Notably, removed the term "the Wizard", using
