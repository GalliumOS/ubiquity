  * Point users to blkid instead of non-existing vol_id (on the

    Closes: #608996

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * On kFreeBSD, mount does not follow symlinks in the mountpoint, so
    the way mount points were set up for removable media caused problems.
    So on that OS only, rather than making /media/cdrom -> /media/cdrom0,
    and putting /media/cdrom0 in /etc/fstab, instead make /media/cdrom
    a directory, and put /media/cdrom in /etc/fstab. This way¸ 
    "mount /media/cdrom", "mount /media/usb" etc all work, and so does
    apt-cdrom add.  Closes: #611569
    (Note that additional CD devices will be set up as /media/cdrom1, etc,
    same as before. This leads to the minor inconsistency on kFreeBSD that
    "mount /media/cdrom1" is needed for the second CD, while
    "mount /media/cdrom0" won't work for the first, but I don't
    see a way to avoid that.)

    - Add currently available usb storage devices to the fstab.
      It is unfortunatly too hard (and probably not wise) to do anything
      if usb is available but no usb storage is plugged in. This will at
      least do reasonable things when installing from usb, or on systems
      with integrated usb storage.
    - Even if there is only one removable device in a class right now, there
      may be more later. So always use the numbered mount points scheme with
      the symlink.
    - Make a /cdrom link to media/cdrom, instead of adding a duplicate fstab
      entry for the device. Closes: #245898
