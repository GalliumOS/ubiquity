SETUPCON(1)               Console-setup User's Manual              SETUPCON(1)



NAME
       setupcon - sets up the font and the keyboard on the console


SYNOPSIS
       setupcon [OPTION]... [VARIANT]


DESCRIPTION
       setupcon  is a program for fast and easy setup of the font and the key-
       board on the console.  Most of the time  you  invoke  setupcon  without
       arguments.   The  keyboard configuration is specified in ~/.keyboard or
       /usr/local/etc/default/keyboard.  The font configuration  is  specified
       in  ~/.console-setup  or /usr/local/etc/default/console-setup.  Consult
       keyboard(5) and console-setup(5)  for  instructions  how  to  configure
       these two files.

       If  you  have to switch often between different encodings, keyboards or
       languages, you can prepare several alternative configuration files  for
       setupcon.   Suppose  that  most of the time you will use Greek language
       with Greek keyboard layout, but sometimes you need to  type  in  German
       with  German  keyboard  layout.  In this situation you should customize
       the main configuration files (keyboard and  console-setup)  for  Greek.
       Create   also   alternative   configuration   files  for  German  named
       keyboard.german and console-setup.german.  Then in order  to  configure
       the  console  for  Greek  you will simply run the command with no argu-
       ments: setupcon and in order to configure the console  for  German  you
       will use setupcon german.



OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Be  more  verbose.    Use this option if something goes wrong or
              while experimenting with the configuration files.


       -k, --keyboard-only
              Setup the keyboard only, do not setup the font.


       -f, --font-only
              Setup the font only, do not setup the keyboard.


       --force
              Do not check whether we are on the console.  Notice that you can
              be  forced to hard-reboot your computer if you run setupcon with
              this option and the screen is controlled by a X server.


       --save This option can be useful if you want to use setupcon  early  in
              the  boot process while /usr is not yet mounted and the required
              data are not available.  This option will make setupcon copy the
              required  files  in  /etc/console-setup/  in  order to make them
              available before /usr is mounted.  If you use setupcon early  in
              the  boot process, then you should run it with this option after
              every change of the console configuration.


       --save-only
              The same as --save, but does not  setup  the  keyboard  and  the
              font.   This  option  can  be useful if you want to save the re-
              quired files while the screen is controlled by a X server.


       -h, --help
              Display usage information.


       VARIANT
              Specifies which configuration file to use.  By default the  con-
              figuration  files  of  setupcon are named console-setup and key-
              board but if you use e.g.  chukchi as VARIANT then the  configu-
              ration files will be console-setup.chukchi and keyboard.chukchi.
              In this way you can have easy access to several  different  con-
              figurations  -  for example one for the Chukchi language and an-
              other for the default configuration.
