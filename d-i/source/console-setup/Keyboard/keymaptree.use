# This list was generated by taking the list of i386 and powerpc keymaps
# offered by console-keymaps-tree from console-data and converting them to X
# keymap layouts and variants. Feel free to add more keymaps to this list,
# as long as gen_keymap (called from keymaptree) still thinks they're
# distinguishable.
