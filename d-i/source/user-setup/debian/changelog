user-setup (1.63ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Add the initial user to the adm, libvirtd and sambashare groups too.
      Do not add them to the audio, video, floppy, netdev, scanner, or
      bluetooth groups.
    - Default passwd/root-login to false.
    - Create the spu group on powerpc/ps3 and powerpc/cell.
    - Make is_system_user always return false if OVERRIDE_SYSTEM_USER is
      set.
    - Add preseedable passwd/auto-login question; if set to true, configure
      gdm, kdm, lxdm, sddm, and lightdm for automatic login.  Add
      passwd/auto-login-backup question which backs up the previous contents
      of the files as well.
    - Ask whether the user wants to encrypt their home directory.
    - Allow forcing the encrypted home option.
    - If a user requests an encrypted-home, we must have their login
      passphrase, in order to wrap their mount passphrase; it's
      fundamentally incompatible to preseed encrypted-home AND a crypted
      password; if this happens, send the user back to password selection.
    - Zero out swap devices at the end of install when encryption is
      enabled.
    - Provide a progress message for wiping swap space.
    - If user-setup/allow-password-empty is preseeded to true, allow empty
      passwords.
    - Disable installation of pre-pkgsel.d/10kdesudo; it does nothing for
      Ubuntu, and causes a confusing message that worries some people.
    - Add weak password detection (purely length-based for now, matching
      partman-crypto).
    - Consider a password of '!' in shadow for root to be unset.
    - Don't restrict guest login from login screen if autologin was
      configured, just restrict autologin for guest specifically.
    - If OVERRIDE_ALREADY_ENCRYPTED_SWAP is set in the environment, assume
      that encrypted swap has already been set up rather than re-creating
      and re-zeroing swap.
    - Add maas to reserved-usernames.

user-setup (1.39ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian testing, remaining changes:
    - Add the initial user to the adm, lpadmin, and sambashare groups
      too. Do not add them to the audio, video, floppy, netdev, powerdev,
      scanner, or bluetooth groups.
    - Default passwd/root-login to false.
    - Create the spu group on powerpc/ps3 and powerpc/cell.
    - Make is_system_user always return false if OVERRIDE_SYSTEM_USER is
      set.
    - Add preseedable passwd/auto-login question; if set to true, configure
      gdm, kdm, lxdm, and lightdm for automatic login. Add
      passwd/auto-login-backup question which backs up the previous contents
      of the files as well.
    - Ask whether the user wants to encrypt their home directory.
    - Allow forcing the encrypted home option.
    - user-setup-ask: if a user requests an encrypted-home, we must have
      their login passphrase, in order to wrap their mount passphrase; its
      fundamentally incompatible to preseed encrypted-home AND a crypted
      password; if this happens, send the user back to the password
      selection in the user-setup state machine
    - Zero out swap devices at the end of install when encryption is
      enabled.
    - Provide a progress message for wiping swap space.
    - If user-setup/allow-password-empty is preseeded to true, allow empty
      passwords.
    - Disable installation of pre-pkgsel.d/10kdesudo; it does nothing for
      Ubuntu, and causes a confusing message that worries some people.
    - Add weak password detection (purely length-based for now, matching
      partman-crypto).
    - Consider a password of '!' in shadow for root to be unset.
    - Update Ubuntu-specific translations from Launchpad.
    - Don't restrict guest login from login screen if autologin was configured, 
      just restrict autologin for guest specifically.
  * Dropped changes:
    - Add the initial user to the dip group after all, not dialout; per
      Debian bug #568895, dip is for pppd and dialout is for raw tty access
      which users don't need.
    - Don't set up the admin group or add the user to it; the sudo package
      now always sets up the sudo group on install, so we can as well use
      this group as the admin group.  This will be inconsistent with
      previous Ubuntu releases, but consistent with Debian and compatible
      with sudo.

    - Ask whether the user wants to encrypt their home directory.
    - If user-setup/allow-password-empty is preseeded to true, allow empty
      passwords.
    - Disable installation of pre-pkgsel.d/10kdesudo; it does nothing for
      Ubuntu, and causes a confusing message that worries some people.
    - Add weak password detection (purely length-based for now, matching
      partman-crypto).
    - Consider a password of '!' in shadow for root to be unset.
  * Rearrange our templates file to put all Ubuntu-specific entries at the
    end, to simplify future merges.
  * Drop compatibility for passwd/allow-password-empty, as promised in the
    changelog for 1.23ubuntu14.
