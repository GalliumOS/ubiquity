- http proxy asking for installs from only CD w/o choose-mirror (for
  security sources)
- If choose-mirror is run to change the mirror in the middle, it starts up
  its own progress bar and then there is no progress bar up after it
  finishes. This was worked around by disabling the progress bar in
  choose-mirror.
