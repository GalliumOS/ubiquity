    message:
      Apply patch from Alec Warner making netcfg respect netcfg/dhcpv6_timeout
      and running dhclient in one-shot mode (-1).

* do other sorts of network configurations (ppp)

* pppconfig would be a good starting point for the ppp udeb.  There is also an
  example in there of how to use pppd to detect a modem.

* Make netcfg-static smarter about default values, e.g. call ifconfig and
  parse.
