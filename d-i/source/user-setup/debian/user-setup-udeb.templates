Template: passwd/root-login
Type: boolean
Default: false
# :sl1:
_Description: Allow login as root?
 If you choose not to allow root to log in, then a user account will be
 created and given the power to become root using the 'sudo' command.

Template: passwd/root-password
Type: password
# :sl1:
_Description: Root password:
 You need to set a password for 'root', the system administrative
 account. A malicious or unqualified user with root access can have
 disastrous results, so you should take care to choose a root password
 that is not easy to guess. It should not be a word found in dictionaries,
 or a word that could be easily associated with you.
 .
 A good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation
 and should be changed at regular intervals.
 .
 The root user should not have an empty password. If you leave this
 empty, the root account will be disabled and the system's initial user
 account will be given the power to become root using the "sudo"
 command.
 .
 Note that you will not be able to see the password as you type it.

Type: boolean
Default: true
# :sl2:
_Description: Create a normal user account now?
 It's a bad idea to use the root account for normal day-to-day activities,
 such as the reading of electronic mail, because even a small mistake can
 result in disaster. You should create a normal user account to use for
 those day-to-day tasks.
 .
 Note that you may create it later (as well as any additional account) by
 typing 'adduser <username>' as root, where <username> is an username,
 like 'imurdock' or 'rms'.

Template: passwd/user-fullname
Type: string
# :sl1:
_Description: Full name for the new user:
 A user account will be created for you to use instead of the root
 account for non-administrative activities.
 .
 Please enter the real name of this user. This information will be used
 for instance as default origin for emails sent by this user as well as
 any program which displays or uses the user's real name. Your full
 name is a reasonable choice.

Template: passwd/username
Type: string
# :sl1:
_Description: Username for your account:
 Select a username for the new account. Your first name is a reasonable choice.
 The username should start with a lower-case letter, which can be
 followed by any combination of numbers and more lower-case letters.

Template: passwd/username-bad
Type: error
# :sl2:
_Description: Invalid username
 The username you entered is invalid. Note that usernames must start with
 a lower-case letter, which can be followed by any combination of numbers
 and more lower-case letters, and must be no more than 32 characters long.

Template: passwd/username-reserved

Template: passwd/shadow
Type: boolean
Default: true
# :sl2:
_Description: Enable shadow passwords?
 Shadow passwords make your system more secure because nobody is able to
 view even encrypted passwords. The passwords are stored in a separate file
 that can only be read by special programs. The use of shadow passwords
 is strongly recommended, except in a few cases such as NIS environments.

Type: boolean
Default: false
# :sl2:
_Description: Encrypt your home directory?
 You may configure your home directory for encryption, such that any files
 stored there remain private even if your computer is stolen.
 .
 The system will seamlessly mount your encrypted home directory each time
 you login and automatically unmount when you log out of all active sessions.

Template: user-setup/encrypt-home-failed
Type: error
# :sl2:
_Description: Home directory encryption failed
 The installer failed to set up home directory encryption. Your home
 directory will be unencrypted after installation. This is probably a bug,
 and you may wish to investigate and reinstall.
 .
 Check /var/log/syslog or see virtual console 4 for the details.
