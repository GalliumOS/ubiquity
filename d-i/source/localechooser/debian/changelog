  * Improve syntax checks for shell scripts during build.
  * If only locale is preseeded and the value includes a locale postfix, then
    treat the locale as preseeded. If only a language and country code are
    passed, then let localechooser determine the locale. The last is done to
    avoid that legacy locales get set accidentally.
  * Drop debian-installer/charmap template. As of console-setup version 1.48
    it is no longer needed. For Lenny installs the lenny-support udeb ensures
    that the template is set to the correct value in the target environment
    before console-setup is installed. Closes: #556289.
  * Allow selection of a "preferred locale" when the user selects a combination
    of language and country for which no locale is defined and there exist
    multiple UTF-8 locales for the language. Improved solution for #552560.
  * Allow users who select a language that has only one locale to select a
    different country at default priority.
  * Emphasize the role of the selected country in setting the time zone.

  * Move selection of additional locales before selection of a default locale

    Closes: #552560.
  * Rewrite of the templates for all primary dialogs to fix style issues and
    improve usability. Add a help dialog for both locale dialogs explaining
    what a locale is.
  * Prevent overriding a language explicitly selected by the user. Makes it
    possible to select pt (pt_PT) as language in combination with BR as country.
  * Allow separate preseeding of language and country. Closes: #469680.
    The old method of specifying only locale remains supported.

    improves support for languages with variants in different countries.
  * Remove redundant check for serial console: variables have already been set
    when the installer was initialized.
  * Build the list of languages for the current display level at runtime
    instead of having separate templates for them. This does make starting
    localechooser slightly slower, but saves memory. Closes: #365307.
  * Ensure we always set debconf/language and call gtk-set-font at the same
    time. Thanks to Jérémy Bobbio for his help tracing this. Closes: #470481.
  * Patch by Matthias Klose stolen from Ubuntu (closes: #468635):
    - iso3166tab.py: Include ErrorPrinter and DefaultHandler from obsolete
      saxutils.py
    - drop build dependency on python-xml
  * Various code cleanups.

    unregistration forces the old question to go away. This replaces
    previous hacks done for the benefit of oem-config.

      question, and recalculate a number of things if so.
