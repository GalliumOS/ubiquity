KEYBOARD(5)               Console-setup User's Manual              KEYBOARD(5)



NAME
       keyboard - keyboard configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The  keyboard file describes the properties of the keyboard. It is read
       by setupcon(1) in order to configure the keyboard on the  console.   In
       Debian   systems   the   default   keyboard   layout  is  described  in
       /etc/default/keyboard and it is shared between X and the console.

       The specification of the keyboard layout in the keyboard file is  based
       on  the  XKB  options  XkbModel,  XkbLayout, XkbVariant and XkbOptions.
       Unfortunately, there is little documentation how to use them.  Descrip-
       tion  of all possible values for these options can be found in the file
       xorg.lst.

       You might want to read "The XKB Configuration Guide" by Kamil Toman and
       Ivan U. Pascal:

       The complete XKB-specification can be found on

              http://xfree86.org/current/XKBproto.pdf

       The file keyboard consists of variable settings in POSIX format:

              VARIABLE=VALUE

       Only  one assignment is allowed per line.  Comments (starting with '#')
       are also allowed.


OPTIONS
       The following variables can be set.


       XKBMODEL
              Specifies the XKB keyboard model name.  Default: pc105 for  most
              platforms.


       XKBLAYOUT
              Specifies  the  XKB  keyboard  layout  name. This is usually the
              country or language type of the keyboard. Default: us  for  most
              platforms


       XKBVARIANT
              Specifies the XKB keyboard variant components. These can be used
              to further specify the keyboard  layout  details.  Default:  not
              set.


       XKBOPTIONS
              Specifies  the  XKB keyboard option components.  Options usually
              relate to the behavior of the special keys (<Shift>,  <Control>,
              <Alt>, <CapsLock>, etc.)  Default: not set.


       BACKSPACE
              Determines  the behavior of <BackSpace> and <Delete> keys on the
              console.  Allowed values: bs, del and guess.  In most cases  you
              can  specify guess here, in which case the current terminal set-
              tings and the kernel of your operating system will  be  used  to
              determine  the  correct value.  Value bs specifies VT100-confor-
              mant behavior: <BackSpace>  will  generate  ^H  (ASCII  BS)  and
              <Delete>  will  generate  ^?   (ASCII DEL).  Value del specifies
              VT220-conformant behavior: <BackSpace> will generate ^?   (ASCII
              DEL) and <Delete> will generate a special function sequence.


       KMAP   Usually this variable will be unset but if you don't want to use
              a XKB layout on the console,  you  can  specify  an  alternative
              keymap here.  Specify a file that is suitable as input for load-
              keys(1) on Linux or for kbdcontrol(1) on FreeBSD.


FILES
       The standard  location  of  the  keyboard  file  is  /usr/local/etc/de-
       fault/keyboard.  Description of all available keyboard models, layouts,
       variants     and     options     is     available      in      /usr/lo-
       cal/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst.       In      most      cases,     in
       /usr/share/keymaps/ or /usr/share/syscons/keymaps/ you will find sever-
       al keymaps that can be used with the variable KMAP.


NOTES
       In Debian systems, changes in /etc/default/keyboard do not become imme-
       diately visible to X.  You should either reboot the system, or use

           udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change


BUGS
       When a triple-layout is used, i.e. a layout with three XKB groups, then
       the  group  toggling  happens in the following way: Group1 -> Group2 ->
       Group1 -> Group3.

       On FreeBSD triple- and quadruple-layouts are not  supported  (only  the
       first and the second layout are taken into account).

       The option grp:shifts_toggle is not supported.


EXAMPLES
       The following configuration will give you the standard US QWERTY layout
       (us).  The key <Menu> will act as  a  compose  key  (compose:menu)  and
       <CapsLock> will act as third control key (ctrl:nocaps).

           XKBLAYOUT=us
           XKBVARIANT=
           XKBOPTIONS=compose:menu,ctrl:nocaps

       In  the  following  configuration the right <Alt> key (grp:toggle) will
       toggle between US QWERTY layout (us) and Greek (gr) layout.  The option
       grp_led:scroll  is  ignored on the console but in X in means to use the
       ScrollLock keyboard led as indicator for  the  current  layout  (US  or
       Greek).

           XKBLAYOUT=us,gr
           XKBVARIANT=
           XKBOPTIONS=grp:toggle,grp_led:scroll

       In  the  following  configuration the <Control>+<Shift> key combination
       will toggle (grp:ctrl_shift_toggle) between French keyboard (fr)  with-
       out dead keys (nodeadkeys) and British (gb) "Dvorak" (dvorak) keyboard.
       The right <Win> key will be a compose-key (compose:rwin) and the  right
       <Alt> key will function as AltGr (lv3:lalt_switch).

           XKBLAYOUT=fr,gb
           XKBVARIANT=nodeadkeys,dvorak
           XKBOPTIONS=grp:ctrl_shift_toggle,compose:rwin,lv3:ralt_switch
