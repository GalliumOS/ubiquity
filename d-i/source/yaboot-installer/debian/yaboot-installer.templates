_Description: Setting firmware variables for automatic boot
 Some variables need to be set in the Genesi firmware in order for your
 system to boot automatically.  At the end of the installation, the
 system will reboot.  At the firmware prompt, set the following
 firmware variables to enable auto-booting:
 .
  setenv boot-device ${OF_BOOT_DEVICE}
  setenv boot-file ${OF_BOOT_FILE}
  setenv auto-boot-timeout 5000
  setenv auto-boot? true
 .
 You will only need to do this once.  Afterwards, enter the "boot" command
 or reboot the system to proceed to your newly installed system.
 .
 Alternatively, you will be able to boot the kernel manually by entering,
 at the firmware prompt:
 .
  ${BOOT}
