* autodetection of ide devices would be nice, rather than always loading
  the ide modules

* clean up the return values, decide what is really a failure, and how to
  handle it

* should we try to detect ISA devices?

* Unify the coreof the load_module function in hw-detect with the module_probe
  functions used by disk-detect and ethdetect. They diverged but do the same
  thing.

* extend devnames to also include disk devices, so that disk-detect
  can include nice descriptions of disk devices. Note that discover's
  descriptions of modules are an alternate source of info, which uses
  different names too. This could stand to be unified.
