NAME
       bdf2psf - convert a BDF font to PSF format for the Linux console


SYNOPSIS
       bdf2psf [--fb] [--log logfile] bdf{+bdf} equivalence{+equivalence} sym-
       bols{+[:]symbols} size psf [sfm]


DESCRIPTION
       The program bdf2psf translates BDF fonts  to  PSF  format.  It  accepts
       fonts with arbitrary size of the font matrix. If the width of the glyph
       matrix of the source font is 7 or 9 pixels then it generates fonts with
       width of 8 pixels.


OPTIONS
       --fb   Generate  font  for framebuffer. There are two important differ-
              ences between the framebuffer and  the  text  mode.  First,  all
              fonts in text mode have to have matrix 8 pixels width. They also
              have to have either 256 or 512  glyphs.  Second,  in  most  text
              modes  the  hardware  does  some  magic in order to use 8 pixels
              width fonts as if they were 9 pixels width. In order to  achieve
              this  the video hardware copies the 8th column in the 9th column
              of the glyphs with codes from 0xC0 to 0xDF  and  from  0x1C0  to
              0x1DF.   Bdf2psf  is very careful when deciding where to place a
              particular glyph and as a result the encoding of  the  generated
              font is more or less arbitrary.


       --log logfile
              Record in the file logfile any problems during the conversion.


       bdf{+bdf}
              The "+"-separated list of the source BDF font(s). When a partic-
              ular symbol is defined in more than one of the  specified  fonts
              then fonts listed first take precedence.


       equivalence{+equivalence}
              A  "+"-separated  list of files defining an equivalence relation
              between the glyphs. See the section EQUIVALENCE FILES below.


       symbols{+[:]symbols}
              A "+"-separated list of files describing  character  sets.   The
              generated  font will support all specified character sets.  When
              there is no space in the PSF font for all symbols, the character
              sets  listed first take precedence.  When a colon before a char-
              acter set is specified no warnings will be  issued  for  symbols
              that  could not be placed in the font. See the section CHARACTER
              SETS below.


       size   The size of the PSF font. Usually 256 or 512 glyphs.


       psf    The name of the generated  font.   If  a  file  with  this  name
              already exists it will be overwritten.


       sfm    Save in the file sfm the SFM of the generated font. This parame-
              ter is optional.


CHARACTER SETS
       The encodings of the traditional console fonts a similar to  the  stan-
       dard encodings of the different languages.  For example there are fonts
       for all variants of ISO 8859.   This  is  redundant,  for  example  ISO
       8859-1,  ISO  8859-9  and ISO 8859-15 differ only by few characters and
       can be easily covered by only one font.

       In order to determine the minimal set of character  sets  a  clustering
       algorithm  has  been used. The source code of fontconfig contains lists
       of the characters that most languages require - one list per  language.
       We  started with one character set per language and used the clustering
       algorithm in order to join the character sets to bigger.  The character
       sets  described  in  files installed in the directory fontsets were the
       result of the algorithm.  These files list the unicodes of the  symbols
       of the character set, one per line. Comments starting with a sharp sign
       are also allowed.

       The files ascii.set, linux.set, freebsd.set and useful.set contain four
       special character sets.  The first lists the ASCII symbols and the sec-
       ond and the third list the symbols from the so called alternate charac-
       ter  set  (see  section "Line Graphics" of terminfo(5)) - one for Linux
       and one for FreeBSD.  Notice that in order to limit itself to the cp437
       character set, the Linux console driver does some approximations of the
       symbols from the alternate character set. For example it prints  U+256A
       (BOX  DRAWINGS  VERTICAL  SINGLE  AND HORIZONTAL DOUBLE) instead of the
       not-equal sign. The file linux.set lists the symbols used by the  Linux
       console  driver  (i.e. U+256A instead of the not-equal sign).  The sym-
       bols from freebsd.set are not fixed by the FreeBSD  kernel,  but  there
       too there are some approximations.

       In  most  cases  there is more available space in the fonts than neces-
       sary. The spare codes can be filled with  the  symbols  from  the  use-
       ful.set  special character set.  It is convenient to use a colon before
       the name of useful.set on the command line of bdf2psf  so  no  warnings
       are  issued  when  there is no space in the font for some of these sym-
       bols.


EQUIVALENCE FILES
       The equivalence files define an equivalence relation between  unicodes.
       The  sharp  sign is used for comments, the empty lines are ignored. All
       other lines should list two or more unicodes.  Only one glyph  will  be
       allocated in the PSF font for these unicodes.

       Example:

            U+2126 U+03A9
            # U+2126:   OHM SIGN
            # U+03A9:   GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA
            U+041D U+0048
            # U+041D:   CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EN
            # U+0048:   LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H

       This  equivalence  file  says  that  U+2126  (the  Ohm sign) and U+03A9
       (Omega) have the same look so only one glyph is enough  for  them.  And
       also U+041D (Cyrillic En) and U+0048 (Latin H) look the same.

       Two  equivalence  files  are  provided  - standard.equivalents and ara-
       bic.equivalents.  The first one can be used for all fonts.  The purpose
       of  the  second is to reduce the number of the necessary glyphs for the
       Arabic letters at the cost of the font quality.  It should be used only
       for  fonts that have to support Arabic but there is not enough space in
       the PSF font for all Arabic characters.  The Uni1 character  set  is  a
       character set that requires arabic.equivalents.


FILES
       All   mentioned   files   and  directories  are  usually  installed  in
       /usr/share/bdf2psf or /usr/local/share/bdf2psf.
