Template: partman-basicfilesystems/no_swap
Type: boolean
Default: false
# :sl2:
_Description: Do you want to return to the partitioning menu?
 You have not selected any partitions for use as swap space. Enabling swap
 space is recommended so that the system can make better use of the
 available physical memory, and so that it behaves better when physical
 memory is scarce. You may experience installation problems if you do not
 have enough physical memory.
 .
 If you do not go back to the partitioning menu and assign a swap partition,
 the installation will continue without swap space.
